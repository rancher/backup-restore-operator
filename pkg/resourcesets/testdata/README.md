The files here are used for the unit tests for BRO code that's applicable. 
Each file correlates to a unit test method and contains the mock data that will be used for filtering.
Because each test method is targeting a specific filter scenario, we need the results to be uniform and assertable.
This is the main reason we opt to create a new set of YAML for each test method and scenario.
